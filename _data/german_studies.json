    "description": "In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches.The SCOOP samples are part of the Obesity group and will undergo exome sequencing. Severe Childhood Onset Obesity Project (SCOOP) is a sub-cohort of the Genetics Of Obesity Study (GOOS) cohort established by Sadaf Farooqi and Steve O’Rahilly at the University of Cambridge over the last 12 years. The GOOS cohort contains &gt;4,000 patients of diverse geographic origin, many of whom have monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity, and includes patients that are offspring of consanguineous union. SCOOP is a subset of &gt;1500 UK Caucasian patients with severe, early onset obesity (all patients have a BMI Standard Deviation Score (SDS) &gt; 3 and obesity onset before the age of 10 years), in whom all known monogenic causes of obesity have been excluded.  GWAS data on the SCOOP cohort will be available (WTCCC2 independent study) at the time of the start of this study. Data from this cohort has demonstrated that the prevalence of the common obesity risk alleles in FTO, MC4R and NEGR1 are amongst the highest within SCOOP, demonstrating its value also in the study of genetic variants with an impact on more common obesity.

    "description": "Background: Massively parallel sequencing technologies have brought an enormous increase in sequencing throughput. However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings. Methods: Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.Results: We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance. Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations, but is of minor importance for the detection of somatic variations.Conclusions: The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials. However, care needs to be taken in regard to the locations of the biopsies taken, which can have an influence on the prediction of copy number variations. Bearing these technological challenges in mind will significantly improve many large-scale sequencing studies and will - on a long-range - result in a more reliable prediction of individual cancer therapies.",

    "description": "We discovered a novel somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, by transcriptome sequencing of 25 lung adenocarcinomas of never smokers. By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-beta3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (p&lt;0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar.

    "studyAbstract": "We discovered a novel somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, by transcriptome sequencing of 25 lung adenocarcinomas of never smokers. By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-beta3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes.

    "description": "Imprinting of the human RB1 gene is due to the presence of a differentially methylated CpG island (CGI) in intron 2, which is part of a retrogene derived from the PPP1R26 gene on chromosome 9. The murine Rb1 gene does not have this retrogene and is not imprinted. We have investigated whether the RB1/Rb1 locus is unique with respect to these differences. For this we have compared the CGIs from human and mouse by in silico analyses and found out that there are at least 2033 human intronic CGIs that are not present in the mouse. Among these CGIs, 104 show sequences similarities elsewhere in the human genome, which suggests that they arose by retrotransposition. We could narrow down the time points when most of these CGIs appeared during evolution. Their methylation status was analysed in two monocyte methylome datasets from whole genome bisulfite sequencing and in 18 published methylomes. Five CGIs appear to be differentially methylated, which suggests that they are subject of genomic imprinting. They are located in introns of the following genes: RB1, ASRGL1, PARP11, PDXDC1 and MYO1D. Four of these CGIs are parts of retrogenes. Our study supports the notion that imprinting builds on host defence mechanisms by which the genome protects itself against retrotransposed and foreign DNA and that the epigenetic fate of the retrotransposed DNA depends on selective forces at the integration site.",

In few cases, SCLC tumors exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC.

    "description": "Human pigmentation traits are of great interest to many research areas, from ancient DNA analysis to forensic science. We aimed to develop a gene-based predictive model for pigmentation phenotypes in a realistic target population for forensic case work from Northern Germany. Our aim was to determine whether better prediction accuracy can be achieved, or fewer genetic markers may suffice, than in previously studied, genetically more heterogeneous populations. We investigated the association between eye, hair and skin colour, and 12 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six genes. Our study comprised two samples of 300 and 100 individuals from Northern Germany who were carefully characterized with regard to pigmentation phenotypes. The first sample was used to select trait-associated SNPs whereas the second sample served to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and to quantify the predictive capability of the respective SNP genotypes. SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 was found to be strongly associated with blue eye colour (OR=15.6, p&lt;1.2•10-4) and to yield reasonable predictive power (90% sensitivity, 63% specificity). SNP associations with hair and skin colour were weaker and genotypes less predictive. A comparison to two recently published sets of markers to predict eye and hair colour revealed that the consideration of additional SNPs with weak to moderate effect increases the predictive power in Northern Germans for eye colour, but not for hair colour. In addition, fine phenotyping and differentiation of hair colour (light / dark and red tint / no red tint) were found to increase the number of significant genotype-phenotype associations.",

Our aim was to determine whether better prediction accuracy can be achieved, or fewer genetic markers may suffice, than in previously studied, genetically more heterogeneous populations. We investigated the association between eye, hair and skin colour, and 12 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six genes. Our study comprised two samples of 300 and 100 individuals from Northern Germany who were carefully characterized with regard to pigmentation phenotypes. The first sample was used to select trait-associated SNPs whereas the second sample served to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and to quantify the predictive capability of the respective SNP genotypes. SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 was found to be strongly associated with blue eye colour (OR=15.6, p&lt;1.2•10-4) and to yield reasonable predictive power (90% sensitivity, 63% specificity). SNP associations with hair and skin colour were weaker and genotypes less predictive. A comparison to two recently published sets of markers to predict eye and hair colour revealed that the consideration of additional SNPs with weak to moderate effect increases the predictive power in Northern Germans for eye colour, but not for hair colour. In addition, fine phenotyping and differentiation of hair colour (light / dark and red tint / no red tint) were found to increase the number of significant genotype-phenotype associations.",

    "description": "Despite the established role of the transcription factor MYC in cancer, little is known about the involvement of lncRNAs in mediating MYC’s function. Here we have intersected RNA-sequencing data from MYC-inducible cell lines, from a cohort of 91 mature B-cell lymphomas and from sorted germinal-center B-cells. By this approach, we identified 13 lncRNAs differentially expressed in IG-MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma and regulated by MYC in the model cell lines. Among them we focused on a lncRNA that we named MINCR, showing a strong correlation with MYC expression in MYC-positive lymphomas and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. RNAi experiments showed that MINCR controls cellular viability by influencing the expression of MYC-regulated cell cycle genes. Finally we provide evidences that down-regulation of AURKA, AURKB and CTD1 may explain the reduction in cellular proliferation observed upon MINCR knock-down. We therefore suggest that MINCR acts as a modulator of MYC transcriptional control of cell cycle genes.",

We examined this in 49 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs clinically discordant for MS at study entry. Since the nuclear DNA of MZ twins is identical, our study provides a unique setting to functionally associate unique mtDNA variants and skewed heteroplasmy with MS development. In order to identify mtDNA variants in the twin cohort, we deeply sequenced the mitochondrial genome in blood of all 49 MZ twin pairs using next generation sequencing (Illumina, HiSeq or MiSeq) with an average coverage depth of ~25,000 sequences per base. Heteroplasmic variants were validated using targeted deep sequencing (TDS) (Illumina, MiSeq) in DNA isolated from blood and buccal swabs. In addition, whole blood was also available of 5 additional MS-affected or healthy siblings and 1 dizygotic twin pair discordant for MS, comprising in total 6 non-identical sib pairs. Moreover, all cases were screened for pathogenic mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations. The data provides valuable insights in the possible involvement of mtDNA variants in the pathogenesis of MS, and gives information on the segregation of heteroplasmic variants within MZ twins and non-identical siblings and across different tissues.",

By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavorable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive2-4. We have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n=39; low-risk, n=17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region (5p15.22) proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumor type1,2,5. In an extended case series (n=217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumors with particularly poor outcome. Despite the large diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumors, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumors, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.22 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cells bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodeling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the center of transformation in a large fraction of these tumors.",

    "description": "Idiopathic achalasia is a severe motility disorder of the esophagus and is characterized by a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax due to a loss of neurons in the myenteric plexus. Most recently, we identified an 8 amino acid insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DQβ1 as strong achalasia risk factor in a sample set from Central Europe, Italy, and Spain. Here, we tested whether the HLA-DQβ1 insertion also confers achalasia risk in the Polish and Swedish population. We could replicate the initial findings and the insertion shows strong achalasia association in both samples (Poland P = 1.84×10-04, Sweden P = 7.44×10-05). Combining all five European data sets – Central Europe, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Sweden – the insertion is achalasia associated with Pcombined = 1.67×10-35. In addition, we observe that the frequency of the insertion shows a geospatial north-south gradient. The insertion is less common in northern (around 6-7% in patients and 2% in controls from Sweden and Poland) compared to southern Europeans (around 16% in patients and 8% in controls from Italy) and shows a stronger attributable risk (AR) in the southern European population. Our study provides evidence that the prevalence of achalasia may differ between populations.",

To tackle this challenge we have developed a novel reChIP-seq approach that enriches for two distinct DNA-associated proteins in an unbiased and genome-wide manner. We illustrate the utility of our approach by identifying nucleosomes bivalently modified by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in primary human CD4+ central memory T-cells (TCMs). We unravel widespread bivalency of many unmethylated CpG-rich regions in TCMs overlapping with transcriptional start sites of developmental regulators. Furthermore, reChIP-seq uncovers two yet unobserved classes of bivalency, where either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 is mixed with low but detectable bivalency. We provide evidence that bivalency is established by an interplay between genome and epigenome and thus attains stability. Our described reChIP-seq approach augments conventional ChIP-seq and is broadly applicable in the study of co-localization of DNA-associated proteins to unravel the intricate possibilities of combinatorial action.",

We also investigated the effect of loading the macrophages with modified LDL. We found that many mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly up- or downregulated during differentiation. While there was no correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation changes at transcription start sites, we identified a large number of intra- and intergenic regions that rapidly lost DNA methylation, became nucleosome-free and gained histone marks indicative of active enhancers. Loading of macrophages with modified LDL caused gene expression changes, but no chromatin changes.

Different classes of memory T cells occur upon primary activation of naive T cells, however, their detailed differentiation pathway is not entirely clear. As part of the IHEC consortium, we generated genome-wide epigenetic maps of a number of CD4+ T cell memory (Tmem) stages including rare subsets such as terminally differentiated (TEMRA) and bone marrow-resident Tmem. We found that CD4+ T cells show progressive global DNA demethylation with differentiation into memory stages, which reflects their proliferative history and likely indicates their decline in differentiation and proliferation potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling combined with co-regulation network analyses arranged different Tmem subsets into a successive differentiation pathway. In addition, we identified a number of epigenetically controlled candidate master regulators for Tmem formation, of which we functionally validated a new methylation-sensitive promoter for the known 'naive-keeper' transcription factor Foxp1.

    "description": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder that is characterized by a great genetic heterogeneity. Recent next generation sequencing studies revealed an accumulation of tumor-associated mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which may also contribute to the activation of survival pathways in MM. To investigate the clinical role of RTK-mutations in MM, we deep-sequenced the coding DNA-sequence of EGFR, EPHA2, ERBB3, IGF1R, NTRK1 and NTRK2 which were previously found to be mutated in MM, in 75 uniformly treated MM patients of the \"Deutsche Studiengruppe Multiples Myelom\". Subsequently, we correlated the detected mutations with common cytogenetic alterations and clinical parameters. We identified 11 novel non-synonymous SNVs or rare patient-specific SNPs, not listed in the SNP databases 1000 genomes and dbSNP, in 10 primary MM cases. The mutations predominantly affected the tyrosine-kinase and ligand-binding domains and no correlation with cytogenetic parameters was found. Interestingly, however, patients with RTK-mutations, specifically those with rare patient-specific SNPs, showed a significant lower overall, event-free and progression-free survival. This indicates that RTK SNVs and rare patient-specific RTK SNPs are of prognostic relevance and suggests that MM patients with RTK-mutations could potentially profit from treatment with RTK-inhibitors.",

We assembled a primary blood cancer cell encyclopedia data set that revealed disease-specific sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), responses to 62% of drugs were associated with 2 or more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway to trisomy 12, an important driver of CLL. Based on drug responses, the disease could be organized into phenotypic subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR, or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR signaling in a non–BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling revealed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status and trisomy 12 as the most important modulators of response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that most mutations do not influence drug response of cancer, and points to an updated approach to understanding tumor biology, with implications for biomarker discovery and cancer care.",

In contrast, the role of FGFR1 in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) has not been established. Prompted by the detection and subsequent therapeutic inhibition of amplified FGFR1 in a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, we investigated the oncogenic properties and potential as drug target of FGFR1 in STS.Experimental Design: The frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling, SNP array profiling, and RNA sequencing, was determined in three independent patient cohorts. The sensitivity of STS cell lines with or without FGFR1 alterations to genetic and pharmacologic FGFR1 inhibition and the signaling pathways engaged by FGFR1 were investigated using short-term viability assays, long-term colony formation assays, and biochemical analysis.Results: Increased FGFR1 copy number was detected in 74 of 190 (38.9%; Cohort 1), 13 of 79 (16.5%; Cohort 2), and 80 of 254 (31.5%; Cohort 3) patients. FGFR1 overexpression occurred in 16 of 79 (20.2%, Cohort 2) and 39 of 254 (15.4%; Cohort 3) patients. Targeting of FGFR1 by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and different small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is primarily dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.Conclusion: These data identify FGFR1 as driver gene in multiple STS subtypes and support FGFR1 inhibition, guided by patient selection according to FGFR1 expression and monitoring of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, as therapeutic option in this challenging group of diseases.H021",

    "description": "Sinonasal carcinomas (SNCs) comprise various rare tumor types that are characterized by marked histologic diversity and largely unknown molecular profiles, yet share an overall poor prognosis owing to an aggressive clinical course and frequent late-stage diagnosis. The lack of effective systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic SNC poses a major challenge to therapeutic decision making for individual patients. Here, we used whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing to identify a KIT exon 11 mutation (c.1733_1735del, p.578_579del) as actionable target in a patient with metastatic SNC whose tumor, despite all diagnostic efforts, could not be assigned to any known SNC category and was refractory to multimodal therapy. Molecularly guided treatment with imatinib resulted in a dramatic and durable response with remission of nearly all tumor manifestations, indicating a dominant driver function of mutant KIT in this tumor. This observation highlights the potential of unbiased genomic profiling for uncovering the vulnerabilities of individual malignancies, particularly in rare and unclassifiable tumors, and underscores that KIT exon 11 mutations represent tractable therapeutic targets across different histologies.H021",

    "description": "Identification of the tissue of origin in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) poses a diagnostic challenge and is critical for directing site-specific therapy. Currently, clinical decision making in patients with CUP primarily relies on histopathology and clinical features. Comprehensive molecular profiling has the potential to contribute to diagnostic categorization and, most importantly, guide CUP therapy through identification of actionable lesions. We here report the case of an advanced-stage malignancy initially mimicking poorly differentiated soft-tissue sarcoma that did not respond to multi-agent chemotherapy. Molecular profiling within a clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing program revealed a heterozygous, highly amplified KRAS G12S mutation, compound-heterozygous TP53 mutation/deletion, high mutational load, and focal amplification of chromosomes 9p (including PDL1 [CD274] and JAK2) and 10p (including GATA3). Integrated analysis of molecular data and conventional histopathology suggested a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and provided a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab, which resulted in rapid clinical improvement and a lasting partial remission. Analysis of 157 TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed focal, high-level PDL1 amplification coinciding with excessive PDL1 mRNA expression in 24% of cases. Collectively, these results illustrate the diagnostic utility of multidimensional tumor profiling in cases with non-descript histology and immune phenotype, demonstrate the predictive power of genomic PDL1 amplification for immune checkpoint inhibition, and suggest a targeted therapeutic strategy in chromosome 9p24.1/PDL1-amplified cancers.H021",

Initially, the 48-year old female diagnosed with high-risk APL had achieved complete molecular remission after standard treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy according to the AIDA protocol. 13 months after start of ATRA maintenance the patient suffered clinically overt meningeal relapse along with minute molecular traces of PML/RARA in the bone marrow. Following treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and ATRA in combination with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate, the patient achieved a complete molecular remission in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow, which currently lasts for two years after completion of therapy. Whole exome sequencing and subsequent ultradeep targeted re-sequencing revealed a heterozygous FLT3-TKD mutation in CSF leukemic cells (p.D835Y, c.2503G&gt;T, 1000/1961 reads (51%)), which was undetectable in the concurrent bone marrow sample. Interestingly, the FLT3-TKD mutated meningeal clone originated from a small bone marrow subclone present in a variant allele frequency of 0.4% (6/1553 reads) at initial diagnosis. This case highlights the concept of clonal evolution with a subclone harboring an additional mutation being selected as the “fittest” and leading to meningeal relapse.

We investigated the mutational spectra of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) at baseline and compared them to those upon clonal evolution at progression on systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Outcome Measurements:DNA was isolated from tumor tissues after surgery, metastasis biopsies after progression on sunitinib or axitinib, and subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES). In addition, the exomes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from two patients were sequenced at baseline and at progression.Results and Limitations:Our data provide evidence for clonal evolution and various acquired resistance mechanisms of ccRCC with subclonal mutations in FLT4, MTOR, ITGA3/5, SETD2, and VHL on metastatic progression. The limited number of shared mutations in tissue and plasma biopsies indicates that both sources provide complementary information, possibly due to mutations present in metastatic lesions which were not amenable to tissue sampling but are represented in the ctDNA. Conclusion:Acquired resistance to targeted therapies in metastatic ccRCC is due to intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Larger patient cohorts have to be studied to estimate the benefit of WES from biopsies and ctDNA for therapy decision in metastatic ccRCC.Patient Summary:We analyzed the molecular profiles of ccRCC patients in primary tissues and metastatic tissues upon progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

    "description": "Loss of the tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53 and MYC amplification are frequent oncogenic events in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We show that Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and Trp53 loss in the mouse lung to promote aggressive, highly metastatic tumors, that are initially sensitive to chemotherapy followed by relapse, similar to human SCLC. Importantly, MYC drives a neuroendocrine-low “variant” subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression corresponding to transcriptional profiles of human SCLC. Targeted drug screening reveals that SCLC with high MYC expression is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition, which combined with chemotherapy strongly suppresses tumor progression and increases survival. These data identify molecular features for patient stratification and uncover a novel targeted treatment approach for MYC-driven SCLC.",

    "title": "The Genetic Landscape of BCL2 Break Negative Follicular Lymphoma",
    "description": "Background: 15% of high and 50% of low stage FL lack the t(14;18). Nevertheless, most of these cases express BCL2 by so far unknown mechanisms. Principals/Methodology: To find molecular mechanisms, triggering FL-pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL, the exonic SNV-profiles of 33 FL with and 16 FL without t(14;18) were assessed by whole exome-sequencing and external SNV-data integration. The SNV-profile of the whole exome-sequenced FL was correlated with copy number, LOH and gene-expression data. Finally, the N-glycosylation status was assessed (LympTrack assay) in a separate validation cohort. Results: SNVs in FL with and without t(14;18) affected different genes, but accumulated in similar pathways, e.g. apoptosis, epigenetic processes and cell cycle/proliferation. Mutations in genes associated with immune-response were more prominently and those associated with NFkB and N-glycosylation selectively enriched in t(14;18)-negative FL. ~50% of mutated genes showed BCL2-asociation at high confidence in FL with and without t(14;18). Moreover, among the genes mutated in t(14;18)-negative FL 555 (~1/3) were affected by copy number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH, 125 were differently expressed between FL with and without t(14;18) (p&lt;0.01) and 62 were differentially expressed and affected by copy number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH. N-glycosylation was strongly reduced in t(14;18)-negative FL as compared to results reported for historical FL cohorts. Conclusion: These results suggest a stronger crosstalk with the microenvironment that may compensate for the lack of N-glycosylation and a diverse portfolio of SNVs that may contribute to the upregulation of BCL2 and FL pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL.",

Whole genome was performed to analyze if the cell lines harbor OC-typical genomic aberrations and to relate genomic features to drug sensitivities. Commonly observed alterations in OC patients like TP53 mutations and MYC or PI3KCA amplifications were absent in the normal cell line but frequently detected in the OC cell lines. Moreover, genome-derived homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores of the OC cell lines correlated with their responses to carboplatin, olaparib and DNA demethylation drugs.

    "description": "Recent developments in sequencing technologies led to the discovery of a novel form of genomic instability, termed chromothripsis. This catastrophic genomic event, involved in tumorigenesis, is characterized by tens to hundreds of simultaneously acquired locally clustered rearrangements on one chromosome. We hypothesized that leukemias developing in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia, who are born with two mutated copies of the ATM gene, an essential guardian of genome stability, would show a higher prevalence of chromothripsis due to the associated defect in DNA double-strand break repair. Using whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic landscape of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) arising in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia. We detected a high frequency of chromothriptic events in these tumors, specifically on acrocentric chromosomes, as compared to tumors from individuals with other types of DNA repair syndromes (27 cases total, 10 with Ataxia Telangiectasia). Our data suggest that the genomic landscape of Ataxia Telangiectasia ALL is clearly distinct from that of sporadic ALL. Mechanistically, short telomeres and compromised DNA damage response in cells of Ataxia Telangiectasia patients may be linked with frequent chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that ATM loss is associated with increased chromothripsis prevalence in additional tumor entities.",

To understand the mechanism driving protumorigenic skewing in CLL, we evaluated the role of tumor cell–derived exosomes in the cross-talk with monocytes. We carried out RNA sequencing and proteome analyses of CLL-derived exosomes and identified noncoding Y RNA hY4 as a highly abundant RNA species that is enriched in exosomes from plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy donor samples. Transfer of CLL-derived exosomes or hY4 alone to monocytes resulted in key CLL-associated phenotypes, including the release of cytokines, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, and interleukin-6, and the expression of PD-L1. These responses were abolished in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–deficient monocytes, suggesting exosomal hY4 as a driver of TLR7 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in a substantially reduced activation of monocytes in vitro and attenuated CLL development in vivo.

    "description": "Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are prone to development of high risk B-cell precursor ALL (DS-ALL) that differs genetically from most sporadic pediatric ALLs. Increased expression of CRLF2, the receptor to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) characterizes about half of DS-ALLs and also a subgroup of sporadic “Philadelphia-like ALLs”. To understand the pathogenesis of relapsed DS-ALL we performed integrative genomic analysis of 25 matched diagnosis remission and relapse DS-ALLs.  We found that the CRLF2 rearrangements are early events during DS-ALL evolution and generally stable between diagnoses and relapse. Secondary activating signaling events in JAK-STAT/RAS pathway were ubiquitous but highly redundant between diagnosis and relapse, suggesting that signaling is essential but that no specific mutations are “relapse driving”. We further found that activated JAK2 may be naturally suppressed in 25% of CRLF2 positive DS-ALL by loss-of-function aberrations in USP9X, a deubuitinase previously shown to stabilize the activated phosphorylated JAK2. Interrogation of large ALL genomic databases extended our findings up to 25% of CRLF2 positive, “Ph like” ALLs. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of USP9X as well as treatment with low-dose Ruxolitinib enhanced the survival of pre-B ALL cells overexpressing mutated JAK2. Thus, somehow counterintuitive, we found that suppression of JAK-STAT “hyper-signaling” may be beneficial to leukemic B cell precursors. This and the reduction of JAK mutated clones at relapse suggest that the therapeutic effect of JAK specific inhibitors may be limited. Rather, combined signaling inhibitors or direct targeting of the TSLP receptor may be a useful therapeutic strategy for DS-ALL.",

This and the reduction of JAK mutated clones at relapse suggest that the therapeutic effect of JAK specific inhibitors may be limited. Rather, combined signaling inhibitors or direct targeting of the TSLP receptor may be a useful therapeutic strategy for DS-ALL.",

The mechanisms underlying LMS development, including clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities, are largely unknown. We performed genomic and transcriptomic profiling of a large cohort of LMS tumors and identified substantial mutational heterogeneity, near-universal inactivation of TP53 and RB1, widespread DNA copy number alterations, chromothripsis, and frequent whole-genome duplication. Furthermore, we discovered recurrent alterations in telomere maintenance genes such as ATRX, RBL2, and RPA1, resulting in alternative lengthening of telomeres in 78% of cases. Finally, most tumors displayed hallmarks of “BRCAness”, including alterations in various homologous recombination DNA repair genes, multiple structural rearrangements, and enrichment of specific mutational signatures, and cultured LMS cells were sensitive towards olaparib and cisplatin treatment.

Here we show that an RFWD3 mutation within the WD40 domain is connected to the genetic disease Fanconi anemia (FA). An individual revealed congenital abnormalities characteristic for FA. Cells from the patient, carrying the compound heterozygous mutations c.205_206dupCC and c.1916T&gt;A in RFWD3, show increased sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents in terms of increased chromosomal breakage, reduced survival and cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The cellular phenotype is mirrored in genetically engineered human and avian cells by inactivation of RFWD3 or by introduction of the patient-derived missense mutation, and is rescued by expression of wildtype RFWD3 protein. HR is disrupted in RFWD3 mutant cells, caused by impaired relocation of mutant RFWD3 to chromatin and defective physical interaction with RPA. Rfwd3 knockout mice exhibit increased embryonic lethality, are sub-fertile, show ovarian and testicular atrophy and have a reduced life span in which they resemble other FA mouse models. Although mutation was detected in a single child with FA yet, we propose RFWD3 as a novel FA gene, FANCW, supported by cellular paradigm systems and an animal model.",

    "title": "Successful immune checkpoint blockade in a patient with advanced stage microsatellite unstable biliary tract cancer (H021)",
    "description": "Cancers acquire multiple somatic mutations that can lead to the generation of immunogenic mutation-induced neoantigens. These neoantigens can be recognized by the host’s immune system. However, continuous stimulation of immune cells against tumor antigens can lead to immune cell exhaustion, which allows uncontrolled outgrowth of tumor cells. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a novel approach to overcome immune cell exhaustion and re-activate anti-tumor immune responses. In particular, antibodies blocking the exhaustion-mediating programmed death receptor (PD-1)/PD-L1 pathway have shown clinical efficacy. The effects were particularly pronounced in tumors with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and a high mutational load, which typically occur in the colon and  endometrium. Here, we report on a 24-year old woman diagnosed with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who showed strong and durable response to the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, although treatment was initiated at an advanced stage of disease. The patient’s tumor displayed DNA mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI), but lacked other features commonly discussed as predictors of response towards checkpoint blockade, such as PD-L1 expression or dense infiltration with cytotoxic T cells. Notably, high levels of HLA class I and II antigen expression were detected in the tumor, suggesting a potential causal relation between functionality of the tumor’s antigen presentation machinery and the success of immune checkpoint blockade. We suggest determining MSI status in combination with HLA class I and II antigen expression in tumors potentially eligible for immune checkpoint blockade even in the absence of conventional markers predictive for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and in entities not commonly linked to MSI phenotype. Further studies are required to determine the value of these markers for predicting the success of immune checkpoint blockade.  (H021)",

While some cases show spontaneous remission, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment option for the majority of patients, however, the 5-year event-free survival reaches only about 50%. Hyperactive RAS signaling is assumed to be the main driving event in JMML. It is caused by genetic alterations in CBL, KRAS, NF1, NRAS, or PTPN11 in about 90% of patients. So far, there is no clear understanding of how RAS pathway mutations relate to the heterogeneous disease biology and variable clinical outcome seen in JMML patients. As a consequence, established clinical and genetic markers fail to fully represent the observed disease heterogeneity. We hypothesized that DNA methylation profiling, either alone or in combination with genetic alterations, might provide a molecular basis for disease classification. Genome wide DNA methylation analysis using the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip array was performed in a discovery cohort of 20 patients (19 JMML, 1 Noonan syndrome).

By interrogating the activity of 1,505 kinase inhibitors we found that BRD4-NUT-rearranged NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) cells are specifically killed by CDK9 inhibition (CDK9i) and exhibit a unique dependency on CDK9 and Cyclin-T1 expression. We show that CDK9i leads to robust induction of apoptosis and of markers of DNA damage response in NMC cells. While both CDK9i and bromodomain inhibition over time result in reduced Myc protein expression, only bromodomain inhibition induces cell differentiation and a p21-induced cell cycle arrest in these cells. Finally, RNA-Seq and ChIP-based analyses reveal a BRD4-NUT specific CDK9i-induced perturbation of transcriptional elongation. Thus, our data provide a mechanistic basis for the genotype-dependent vulnerability of NUT midline carcinoma cells to CDK9i that may be of relevance for the development of targeted therapies for NMC patients.",

Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i.e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating cancer presence.In order to discover the most relevant CpG regions, we used RRBS and analysed several tissue samples: 11 prospectively collected invasive epithelial ovarian cancer samples (high grade serous n=8, low grade serous n=1, endometrioid n=1, mucinous n=1, mean age = 54.7 years), 8 prospectively collected invasive ductal breast cancer samples (2/8 triple negative; mean age = 56.6 years), one benign tumor (papillary serous cystadenoma, age = 86 years), 18 non-neoplastic tissue samples (breast n=7 and adnexal n=11, mean age = 60.2 years), two non-neoplastic endometrial tissues (mean age = 68 years) and twenty three white blood cell samples (mean age = 57.8 years) were assessed by RRBS. Genome wide methylation analysis was performed by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) at GATC Biotech. DNA was digested with MspI followed by size selection of the library, providing enhanced coverage for the CpG-rich regions. The digested DNA was adapter ligated, bisulfite modified and PCR amplified. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina’s HiSeq 2500. Analysis of the first samples sequenced with 100bp paired-end mode showed that the library insert size was small. Therefore, the remaining samples were sequenced with 50 bp paired-end mode. Using Genedata Expressionist® for Genomic Profiling v9.1, we established a bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of cancer specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The most promising DMRs were taken forward for the development and validation of serum based clinical assays.",

Here we have used Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips to interrogate the DNA methylation status of about 850.000 CpGs in epidermal preparations from healthy skin, AK and cSCC. Importantly, we found that the premalignant AK samples displayed classical features of cancer methylomes and were highly similar to cSCC methylomes. Further analysis identified typical features of stem cell methylomes, such as a reduced DNA methylation age, non-CpG methylation and stem cell-related keratin and enhancer methylation patterns. Interestingly, this signature was detected only in one half of the AK and cSCC samples, while the other half showed keratin and enhancer methylation patterns that were more closely related to the control epidermis. These findings suggest the existence of two distinct subclasses of AK and cSCC that originate from distinct keratinocyte differentiation stages.",

    "title": "Aberrant ERBB4-SRC Signaling as a Hallmark of Group 4 Medulloblastoma Revealed by Integrative Phosphoproteomic Profiling",
    "description": "The four main medulloblastoma subgroups are characterized by distinct biology, clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes. While the WNT and SHH subgroups are characterized by clearly defined aberrant signaling of developmental pathways, the underlying biology of Group 3 and 4 remains poorly understood. Here, we delineate distinct post-translational regulation orchestrating active oncogenic signaling networks in Groups 3 and 4. Specifically, aberrant ERBB4-SRC signaling constitutes a novel hallmark feature of Group 4, with great promise as a novel oncogenic mechanism and potential vulnerability for therapeutic intervention in the most common subgroup. Altogether, this novel integrative proteogenomic landscape demonstrates the added value of proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis to discover and exploit unexpected oncogenic mechanisms in medulloblastoma and beyond.",

Whole exome sequencing showed that somatic alterations are stably maintained between patient tumors and PDXs. Early-passage PDXs maintain the genomic and transcriptional profiles of the founder PDX. In vivo treatment with etoposide and cisplatin (EP) in 30 PDX models demonstrated greater sensitivity in PDXs from EP naïve patients, and resistance to EP corresponded to increased expression of a MYC gene signature.

Nevertheless, outcomes of relapsed BCP-ALL remain unsatisfactory, particularly in adult patients where the molecular basis of relapse is still poorly understood. To elucidate the evolution of relapse in BCP-ALL, we established a comprehensive multi-omics dataset including DNA-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation array and proteome MASS-spec data from matched diagnosis and relapse samples of BCP-ALL patients (n = 50) including the subtypes DUX4, Ph-like and two aneuploid subtypes. Relapse-specific alterations were enriched for chromatin modifiers, nucleotide and steroid metabolism including the novel candidates FPGS, AGBL and ZNF483. The proteome expression analysis unraveled deregulation of metabolic pathways at relapse including the key proteins G6PD, TKT, GPI and PGD. Moreover, we identified a novel relapse-specific gene signature specific for DUX4 BCP-ALL patients highlighting chemotaxis and cytokine environment as a possible driver event at relapse. This study presents novel insights at distinct molecular levels of relapsed BCP-ALL based on a comprehensive multi-omics integrated data set including a valuable proteomics data set. The relapse specific aberrations reveal metabolic signatures on genomic and proteomic levels in BCP-ALL relapse.

Characterisation of genomic alterations across 270 PCa tumours revealed age-related genomic alterations and mutation signatures including BRCAness and APOBEC. We used methylation- and expression-data to identify four molecular subgroups, which included a highly aggressive tumour subgroup that frequently involved recurrent duplications and increased expression of ESRP1. Analysis of 12,000 tissue-microarray tumour samples demonstrated that ESRP1 is a candidate biomarker associated with faster proliferation rate and shorter time to relapse.

Many clinical applications require high precision, especially if rare events such as somatic mutations in cancer or genetic variants causing rare diseases need to be identified. Although random sequencing errors can be modeled statistically and deep sequencing minimizes their impact, systematic errors remain a problem even at high depth of coverage. Understanding their source is crucial to increase precision of clinical NGS applications. In this work, we studied the relation between recurrent biases in allele balance (AB), systematic errors and false positive variant calls across a large cohort of human samples analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). We have modeled the allele balance distribution for biallelic genotypes in 987 WES samples in order to identify positions recurrently deviating significantly from the expectation, a phenomenon we termed allele balance bias (ABB). Furthermore, we have developed a genotype callability score based on ABB for all positions of the human exome, which detects false positive variant calls that passed state-of-the-art filters.

The high prevalence of BD in these pedigrees renders them promising in terms of the identification of genetic risk variants with large effect sizes.

The identified variants were shared by all investigated BD cases in the respective pedigree. The most promising variant was located in the gene SERPING1 (p.L349F), which has been reported as a genome-wide significant risk gene for schizophrenia.

    "description": "We established a platform for high-throughput confocal fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis to perform large-scale drug response profiling with patient derived organoids (PDOs). Using PDO lines newly established from colorectal cancer patients with a standardized workflow, we performed chemical perturbations with more than 500 experimental and clinically used compounds. Subsequently, we captured approx. six million images by confocal microscopy. To analyze drug-induced PDO re-organization on a single organoid level we developed SCOPE, a software framework for automated PDO high-throughput image analysis. We observed a rich variety of divergent and reoccurring compound induced phenotypes in organoids. Perturbation of cellular processes, including signaling by MEK, GSK3β, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and others, led to recurring and distinct architectural changes. Highlighting the clinical relevance, PDO viability was heterogeneous after perturbation with anticancer drugs and matched clinical response of corresponding colorectal cancer patients. Our work opens new avenues for image-based profiling for accelerated drug discovery and clinical decision-making.",

    "description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although genetic susceptibility is important, a modest concordance rate for MS in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that interaction with other risk factors is required to develop clinical symptoms. In this study, we examined whether DNA methylation differences contribute to the discordant clinical manifestation of MS in MZ twins, and studied the impact of MS treatments on the DNA methylome. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 45 MZ twins clinically discordant for MS were generated using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. Repetitive element methylation and selected differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were validated using targeted deep bisulfite sequencing (TDBS). In addition, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to profile CD4+ memory T-cells of a subset of four MS discordant MZ twins. Our results show that interferon treatment causes robust DNA methylation changes and several epigenetic biomarkers for interferon treatment response were identified. However, overall the PBMC-based methylomes of the MS discordant MZ twins were highly similar, since large systematic methylation differences (&gt;5%) were absent in the data. This suggests that previously reported large methylation changes are probably caused by genetic rather than epigenetic differences. In addition, our data does not support the hypothesis that the observed maternal parent-of-origin effect in MS is due to genomic imprinting errors, and no evidence was found that copy number variations explain the discordant phenotype in these MZ twins. Although not genome-wide significant, a couple of DMPs associated with the MS phenotype were identified and successfully technically replicated using TDBS, including a differentially methylated region (DMR) in the promoter of the transmembrane protein encoding gene TMEM232. Another MS-associated DMP, located in an enhancer in the gene body of the transcription factor ZBTB16, was also associated with medium-term glucocorticoid treatment history. WGBS analysis confirmed this DMP as a promising epigenetic biomarker for glucocorticoid treatment. In conclusion, this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in genetically identical twins identified a DMR in the TMEM232 promoter as a candidate loci associated with the clinical manifestation of MS. In addition, epigenetic biomarkers for MS treatments were identified, revealing that not only short-term, but also medium-term treatment effects are detectable in immune cells, which should be taken into account in future EWAS designs.",

To gain insights into the pathogenesis of these divergent subtypes, we performed massively parallel sequencing of 416 pretreatment neuroblastomas and assessed telomere maintenance mechanisms in 208/416 cases. We observed that telomere maintenance and mutations in RAS or p53 pathway genes strongly affected disease courses. Fatal outcome occurred only in the presence of telomere maintenance, whereas patients whose tumors lacked such mechanisms had excellent outcome. In patients with telomere maintenance-positive tumors, survival was dramatically inferior when additional RAS/p53 pathway mutations were present. By contrast, spontaneous regression occurred both in the presence and absence of RAS/p53 pathway mutations in patients with telomere maintenance-negative tumors.

Here, we quantify the impact of translation on gene expression and annotate novel translational events in 80 human hearts.

We show that translational regulation modulates disease-associated molecular processes. Further, we evaluate ribosome dynamics at protein truncating variants revealing incomplete termination of translation at titin-truncating variants (TTNtv) that commonly cause DCM. Finally, we identify dozens of unknown microproteins translated from lncRNAs and circRNAs and link these to mitochondrial processes. Several microproteins are expressed from lncRNAs with previously demonstrated function, suggesting a dual coding and noncoding role.

Analysis of mutations in cell free (cf) DNA offers a non-invasive approach to detect mutations that may be prognostic for disease survival or predictive for primary or secondary drug resistance.

Here, we developed a flexible end-to-end experimental and bioinformatics workflow to analyze mutations in cfDNA using custom amplicon sequencing. Our approach relies on open software tools to select primers suitable for multiplex PCR using minimal cfDNA as input. In addition, we developed a robust linear model to identify specific genetic alterations from sequencing data of cfDNA. We used our method to design a custom amplicon panel suitable for detection of hotspot mutations relevant for colorectal cancer and analyzed mutations in serial cfDNA samples from 34 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Our data demonstrates that recurrent and patient-specific mutational patterns can be reliably detected for the majority of patients. Furthermore, we show that the allele frequency of mutations in cfDNA correlates well with disease progression. Finally, we demonstrate that monitoring of cfDNA can outperform the predictive power of currently used tumor markers and reveal mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR antibody treatment.",

We previously established the six meningioma methylation classes (MC) benign-1, 2, 3, intermediate-A, B and malignant.\n\nHere, we set out to identify subgroup-specific mutational patterns and pathway regulation. Whole-genome-sequencing was performed on 62 samples across all MCs and WHO grades from 62 patients with matched blood control, including 40 sporadic and 22 radiation-induced (Mrad) meningiomas. RNA sequencing was added for 18 cases and chromatin-immunoprecipitation for the enhancer mark H3K27ac followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for 16 samples.\n\nBesides the known mutations in meningioma, structural alterations were found to contribute to the spectrum of mechanisms inactivating NF2 in sporadic meningioma similar to previous reports for Mrad. Aberrations of DMD were found to be enriched in MCs with NF2 mutations and DMD was among the most differentially upregulated genes in NF2 mutant compared to NF2 wild-type cases. The mutational signature AC3 was detected in both sporadic meningioma and Mrad, but distributed across the genome in sporadic cases and enriched near genomic breakpoints in Mrad. In general, the malignant MC presented a significantly higher exposure to AC3 and higher genomic instability beyond the mutational load than the other MCs. Pathway analysis of the ChIP-seq clusters revealed that the FOXM1 is most differentially activated in high-grade cases, along with super enhancer recruitment near HOX genes and respective upregulation of expression.\n\nThis data further elucidate the biological mechanisms differentiating meningiomas of different WHO grade and epigenetic subgroups and suggest leveraging the genomic instability as novel therapeutic targets.",

    "studyAbstract": "Neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid nerve sheath tumors (N/S HNSTs) are neoplasms associated with larger nerves that occur sporadically and in the context of schwannomatosis or neurofibromatosis (NF). Clinical management of N/S HNST is challenging, especially for large tumors, and established systemic treatments are lacking. We identified activating mutations (p.Leu755Ser, p.Asp769Tyr, p.Val777Leu) in the catalytic domain of the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase in schwannomatosis-associated (4 of 8 patients) N/S HNSTs but not in tumors arising in the context of NF (0 of 6 patients), and observed that ERBB2-mutant N/S HNSTs define a distinct subgroup of peripheral nerve sheath tumors based on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns. The small-molecule ERBB inhibitor lapatinib led to prolonged clinical benefit and a lasting radiographic and metabolic response in a patient with schwannomatosis-associated, ERBB2-mutant N/S HNST. These findings uncover a key biological feature of N/S HNST that may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. (H021)",

Although MCPyV was found to be integrated in only the MCC part, six somatic mutations were shared by both tumor components. The mutational overlap between trichoblastoma and MCPyV-positive MCC part of the combined tumor implies that MCPyV integration occurred in an epithelial tumor cell prior to MCC development. Therefore, it appears likely that cells of the epithelial lineage are the origin of MCPyV-positive MCC",

Therefore, we have recently developed new preclinical models to study promising novel agents for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. The checkpoint kinase (chk) inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368) and its salt form (LSN2940930) have recently been shown to be active in adult and pediatric malignancies, including sarcoma. We have now tested the potency of prexasertib in clonogenic survival assays in two new lines of primary patient-derived osteosarcoma cells and in two established osteosarcoma cell lines as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor talazoparib. Prexasertib alone results in strongly reduced clonogenic survival at low nanomolar concentrations and acts by affecting cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis and induction of double-stranded DNA breakage at concentrations that are well below clinically tolerable and safe plasma concentrations. In combination with cisplatin and talazoparib, prexasertib acts in a synergistic fashion. Chk1 inhibition by prexasertib and its combination with the DNA damaging agent cisplatin and the PARP-inhibitor talazoparib thus emerges as a potential new treatment option for pediatric osteosarcoma which will now have to be tested in preclinical primary patient derived in vivo models and clinical studies.",

Most intriguingly, BP is distinct from other autoimmune diseases because it predominantly affects elderly individuals above the age of 75 years, raising the question why autoantibodies and the clinical lesions of BP emerges mostly in this later stage of life, even in individuals harboring known putative BP-associated germline gene variants. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is a potential candidate to provide additional insights into the BP etiology; however, the mtDNA has not been extensively explored to date. Therefore, we sequenced the whole mtDNA of German BP patients (n=180) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=188) using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, followed by the replication study using Sanger sequencing of an additional independent BP (n=89) and control cohort (n=104). While the BP and control groups showed comparable mitochondrial haplogroup distributions, the haplogroup T exhibited a tendency of higher frequency\nin BP patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (ND) compared to BP patients without ND (p= 0.1448, Fisher’s exact test). A total of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mtDNA, namely, m.16263T&gt;C, m.11914G&gt;A, m.16051A&gt;G, and m.16162A&gt;G, were found to be significantly associated with BP based on the meta-analysis of our NGS data and the Sanger sequencing data (p=0.0017, p=0.0132, p=0.0129, and p=0.0076, respectively, Peto’s test). In summary, our study is the first to interrogate the whole mtDNA in BP patients and controls and to implicate multiple novel mtDNA variants in disease susceptibility.
