                <p>Given the importance of omics data across biomedical domains,
                  there are several communities to whom the GHGA infrastructure
                  will be highly relevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Initially, the focus of GHGA will be on the cancer and rare disease communities.
                  Major data generators will be encouraged to deposit their data
                  in GHGA, and community reference datasets (i.e. data likely
                  to be used regularly in downstream analyses) will be developed.
                  Interactions with the communities will take place in targeted
                  workshops, vial talks and/or panel discussions at general
                  conferences and meetings.
                  </p>
                  On a broader scale, interactions will also take place with
                  other GHGA users, including human omics data researchers, data
                  scientists, clinical researchers, physicians, and citizen
                  scientists.
                  <br>
                  An important aim of GHGA is to reach out to patient representatives
                  and the general public, to raise awareness for the value
                  of omics research and data sharing, while addressing general
                  concerns and questions about the safety, privacy and data
                  ownership when using such large scale human data.
                  <br>
                  The table below shows some of the scientific societies,
                  research networks, and patient networks that have already
                  expressed their interest in GHGA. Taken together, these
                  societies represent over 60,000 physicians and researchers
                  in Germany.
