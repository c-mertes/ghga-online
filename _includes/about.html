                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Human genome sequencing and other omics data modalities are of
                critical importance for biomedical research and the future
                development of healthcare.
                GHGA will provide the infrastructure to meet both the desire
                to handle omics data in an open and FAIR manner
                and the need to keep personal data safe and secure. Other than
                other European infrastructures, as a National consortium, GHGA
                will have the ability to address the legal requirements specific
                to Germany, enabling German researchers to help shape future
                international standards for data exchange and take on leading
                roles in international research consortia.

                <h3>The Structure of the consortium</h3>
                <p>
                GHGA is tightly embedded and connected to international
                infrastructures and iniatives. It will be operated as a local
                node withing the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/">EGA</a>
                federation framework.<br>

                <h3>The Consortium within the NFDI</h3>
                <p>
                GHGA has a unique role within the network of NFDI consortia as
                it is the only consortium managing controlled/access omics data.
                It aims at linking this data to other consortia, especially in
                the biomedical field, and thereby become a central component of a
                long-term research data management strategy within the NFDI. In
                particular the coordination with <b>NFDI4MED</b> and <b>NFDI4Health</b>
                will provide complementary expertise on the management and record
                linkage of medical records and other non-omics data types.<br>
                GHGA is in full support of the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3457213#.XcwcPNUxkUE">Berlin Declaration on NFDI Cross-Cutting Topics</a>.
