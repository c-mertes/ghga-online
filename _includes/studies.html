                <p>
                    We intend to optimize the procedures and processes involved with the deposition and access to
                    human datasets. These procedures should be simplified from a technical and organisational
                    perspective while ensuring full compliance to data protection and safety standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To this aim a diverse and distributed data infrastructure, involving major data generators and
                    build using scalable cloud technologies, will have to be integrated and exposed to researcher
                    via a simple data access portal. Additionally, the communication with data access committees
                    and the technical details of regulating distributed data access need to be streamlined.
                </p>
