## Developers & Testers

The site uses Jekyll. To test the website locally, follow the instructions in the Github <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll" target="_blank">Help</a>.

If you have `gem` installed you can do 

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

Note that before you can run `jekyll serve` you additionally need to install the Jekyll theme:

```bash
gem install jekyll-theme-slate
```
